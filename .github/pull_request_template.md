**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first.**

*Any change needs to be discussed before proceeding. If not, we'll (hopefully) nicely ask you to create an issue for discussion.*

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

<!-- You can skip this if you're fixing a typo. -->

Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

<!-- Example: When "Adding a function to do X", explain why it is necessary to have a way to do X. -->

**Test plan (required)**

Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: Screenshots / videos are helpful if the pull request changes UI.
