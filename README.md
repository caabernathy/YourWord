# YourWord 

YourWord is a Bible memorization demo iOS app inspired by [Malachi Daily](https://www.malachidaily.com/) and
built mostly with Generative AI and a sprinkle of help from [Kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com/) and
[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).

The initial project's goal was to tease out the development workflow with Generative AI tools and build
out a simple demo that could be used for tutorials and mentoring others.
